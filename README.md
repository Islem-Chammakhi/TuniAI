## How It Works
Users can simply snap a photo of a monument, and our platform instantly recognizes it, narrates its history, and generates a 3D street view to explore the surrounding area. To enhance the travel experience, 
it also features a smart trip planner that builds personalized itineraries based on the traveler’s interests, budget, and schedule. And lastly, an interactive map that highlights key monuments across Tunisia
and offers brief descriptions and rich cultural insights to guide and inspire exploration.

## AI & Integrations
At its core, our app combines multiple AI technologies: a fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model for monument recognition, voice narration delivered via Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech, and a trip planning system 
powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash.
